# Exploring TDD with Javascript #

This is a live webcast which covers test-driven development, and demonstrates ways to approach problem solving using tests. Along with the code included in this repo, there are other resources.

## Snippets ##

I use Visual Studio Code when working with Javascript. I use lots, and lots, and LOTS of snippets to automate away the most uninteresting parts of my development day.

To use the snippets included in this repository:

1. Press F1 to open the command palette
2. Type "snippets" and select "Preferences: Configure user snippets"
3. Select "javascript.json" or "javascript" from the languages drop-down (the display may show one or the other)
4. Copy the snippets from exploring-tdd-snippets.json in this repository, and paste them into your javascript.json file.
5. Save and enjoy!
